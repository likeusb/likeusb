I'm a student who is interested in a few things. The primary interest is Aviation and Gaming, but I also enjoy Photography, and also Coding.

Currently, I don't have that much free time to do anything other than gaming and I also am not old enough for aviation, but I enjoy learning about topics related to my interests.

The projects I'm currently working on are:
- My photography site
- A phone recommendation site
